### **Program period**

May 13 2021, 3:00 AM \(UTC\) — Aug 5 2021, 3:00 AM \(UTC\)

### **How to participate**

There will be two parts in the season 3 program. Each user can decide which part\(s\) to join to earn the weekly rewards.

1. Liquidity Farming: Stake COMBO or COMBO/ETH LP token to earn rewards.
2. Usage Farming: Gas reimbursement + weekly challenge to join NFT lotteries.

### 1. Liquidity Farming

Unlike season 2, this time stakers don’t need to make transactions every week to get the weekly rewards.

* The reward is calculated pro-rata with \(Stake Amount\) x \(Stake duration\).
* Weekly distribution, 6-week vesting
* Weekly budgets: - COMBO Staking: 10,000 COMBO - COMBO/ETH Uni-V2 LP Staking: 77,500 COMBO
* All budgets will be shared with the respective stakers.

To maximize rewards, we recommend that you stake COMBO tokens or COMBO/ETH Uni-V2 LP tokens as soon as you own some. Because the earlier you stake, the bigger your staking area will be, hence higher rewards.

### 2. Usage Farming

Usage Farming aims to encourage people to use and to try out the magic of Furucombo. **This is a basic gas reimbursement program, but users who hold Furucombo NFTs can also boost their rewards up to 2 times.**

* The reward is calculated pro-rata with \(Gas Used\) x \(Gas Price\) x NFT effect / \(COMBO Price in ETH\)
* Weekly distribution, no vesting
* Cap: - 100,000 COMBO as total weekly rewards. If the cap is reached, all rewards will be scaled down together. **- Maximum gas used per address = 1,200,000 gas limit.** This will cover around three transactions on average.
* Which transactions will count? - Basically all transactions you send on the combo page that involve token transfers. - Failed transactions will also count. - Token approvals are not counted because they do not interact with Furucombo. - Using wallets such as Argent and DappLogic will not be counted because the behavior of these wallets is quite unique. - Quick check? If your transaction has the tag “Interacted With \(To\): Furucombo: Proxy vx.x.x” on etherscan, it will be counted.

Back by popular demand, we are excited to announce the launch of the Furucombo COMBO mining season 2 program! As we always say, the future of Furucombo is in the hands of our community. Hence, the primary purpose of COMBO mining season 2 is to continuously and steadily distribute COMBO tokens to our users and COMBO holders. We hope that season 2 will continue to bring significant growth and benefit to our esteemed community while further accelerating and enhancing the ecosystem.

## Furucombo COMBO mining season 2

### **Program period**

Mar 11 2021, 3:00 AM \(UTC\) — May 6 2021, 3:00 AM \(UTC\)

### **How to participate**

Anyone can participate in the COMBO mining season 2 program. Every week, you just need to complete the following two steps, then you will receive your COMBO rewards.

### **Steps:** <a id="0cbf"></a>

1. **Eligibility requirement:** Be an active user! Send out at least one transaction on Furucombo during each week’s program. - A token approval transaction will not be counted as an eligible transaction since it will not interact with Furucombo. - Using wallets such as Argent and DappLogic will not be counted as an eligible transaction as well since these wallets’ behavior is quite unique. Quick check? If your transaction has the tag “Interacted With \(To\): Furucombo: Proxy vx.x.x” on etherscan, it will be counted. ****
2. **Staking area:** The amount and length of time of your staked COMBO tokens or COMBO/ETH LP tokens. - Staking area = staking amount x staking duration

To maximize rewards, we recommend that you stake COMBO tokens or COMBO/ETH Uni-V2 LP tokens as soon as you own some. Because the earlier you stake, the bigger your staking area will be, hence higher rewards.

Compared to the season 1 program, the season 2 program focus on if users use Furucombo to trade at least once a week or not, instead of trading rank or eligible cubes.

### **Reward details**

1. **Reward distribution:** Total 187,500 COMBO per week

The weekly rewards are being vested starting from April 8th. It would be unlocked on a weekly basis during a 12-week period.

* COMBO Pool \(stake COMBO token\) - Rewards: 46,875 COMBO - Competition rule: Base amount = 250 COMBO - Every active user, no matter if they stake or not, will share the rewards in this pool. If you have made trades but staked 0 COMBO, we will automatically act as if staked 250\*COMBO when calculating the rewards; if you have made trades and have staked 1000 COMBO, we will act as if you have staked 1250 COMBO when calculating the rewards. 
* COMBO/ETH Uniswap V2 Liquidity Pool \(stake LP token\) - Rewards: 140,625 COMBO - Only active users who stake LP tokens will be able to share the rewards in this pool.

The transaction mining program will distribute COMBO tokens as rewards on a weekly basis. \*\*Furucombo team will calculate rewards every Thursday and share the result in our [Discord channel](https://discord.furucombo.app/) for community review. If no disputes are raised within 24hrs, the unlocked amount will then be updated to the Furucombo contract \(Typically by Friday night\). You can then claim your rewards through a “Claim COMBO” cube.\*\*

**2. Rewards Calculation**

* The reward distribution is decided by the weekly eligibility requirement and weekly staking area. Please note that the staking area = staking amount x staking duration. In other words, you’d want to stake as many tokens for as long as possible to optimize your rewards. \*You can find the script of the rewards calculation [here](https://github.com/dinngodev/furucombo-reward-scripts).

How to stake COMBO

Additionally, you may want to claim COMBO tokens and then stake them right away. Try to use Furucombo to bundle your trading actions into one transaction to claim and stake easily and seamlessly!

How? → [https://go.furucombo.app/e0fQg](https://go.furucombo.app/e0fQg)

1. Claim COMBO
2. Add funds — COMBO
3. Stake COMBO

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/1*hN5wtv-cYfSr-BZ8Ok-iQA.png)

The reason why you must put an “Add funds” cube in the middle is because when Furucombo executes the “claim COMBO” cube, the COMBO tokens go straight to your wallet but not to the Furucombo proxy. In order to let Furucombo proxy continue executing the “Stake COMBO” cube, you need to send the claimed COMBO back to the Furucombo proxy.

That’s it! Enjoy participating in our COMBO mining season 2 and earning COMBO tokens in the following weeks. If you have any questions on this, our team is standing by in [Discord](https://discord.furucombo.app/) to answer any questions. Thanks for participating in the Furucombo community!

**Things to Note**

* This is the second round of the Furucombo mining program in a series. Any future rounds may have different rules and rewards.
* Furucombo reserves the right to change, amend and add new rules agreed by the community during the program period.

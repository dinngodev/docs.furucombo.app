# Furucombo Introduction

## What is Furucombo?

Furucombo is a tool built for end-users to optimize their DeFi strategy simply by drag and drop. It visualizes complex DeFi protocols into cubes. Users setup inputs/outputs and the order of the cubes, then Furucombo bundles all the cubes into one transaction and sends out. We call this building-blocks setup a “combo”. If you don’t know what to do, you can find inspirations from pre-built combos at [Explore page](https://furucombo.app/explore).

## How do you make money then?

We are exploring different possibilities now, feel free to share your ideas at our [Discord](https://discord.furucombo.app/) community!

## What is the risk of using Furucombo?

On Furucombo, we use a proxy contract and handler contracts to execute your transactions across different DeFi protocols. Once the transaction is executed successfully, the proxy contract sends all the funds back to your wallet. That being said, Furucombo does not hold any funds.

## Is Furucombo open-sourced?

You can find our proxy contract is verified [on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/Furucombo), where you can see the contract source code.  
The rest of Furucombo is not open-sourced yet.

# Furucombo Introduction

## What is Furucombo?

Furucombo starts from a tool built for end-users to optimize their DeFi strategy simply by drag and drop, and it's now a DeFi portal to help you optimzie your crypto wealth.&#x20;

**Invest mode** Explore and Invest in Furucombo's wealth management farms with ease and let us help you make the most of your money.

**Create mode** It visualizes complex DeFi protocols into cubes. Users setup inputs/outputs and the order of the cubes, then Furucombo bundles all the cubes into one transaction and sends out. We call this building-blocks setup a “combo”.&#x20;

## Do you charge any fees?

Most of the services and features are free from charge, except the auto-invest feature as 20% performance fees are collected and managed by Furucombo Treasury.

## What is the risk of using Furucombo?

**Invest mode** Most of pools are developed and deployed by external DeFis (e.g. Uniswap, Yearn, etc) and are subject to their smart contract risks. Currently only the smart contracts of the auto-invest Farms are developed be Furucombo team and those contracts have been [audited](https://docs.furucombo.app/audit#furucombo-smart-wallet-and-auto-farming-feature-contract).

**Create mode** On Furucombo, we use a proxy contract and handler contracts to execute your transactions across different DeFi protocols. Once the transaction is executed successfully, the proxy contract sends all the funds back to your wallet. That being said, the proxy contract does not hold any funds.

## Is Furucombo open-sourced?

You can find our proxy contract is verified [on Etherscan and Polygon](https://docs.furucombo.app/resources/smart-contracts), where you can see the contract source code.\
The rest of Furucombo is not open-sourced yet.

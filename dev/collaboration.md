### How to launch an auto-invest Quickswap LP mining campaign?

1. Use [Furucombo Trevi](https://docs.furucombo.app/dev/furucombo-trevi) to create your staking and reward distribution contracts with a few clicks.
2. Introduce yourself and share the above contracts through our [Discord](https://discord.furucombo.app/) #developer channel.

We will then schedule to set up the automation tasks so your stakers can compound the rewards and maximize the APY automatically.&#x20;

For elite projects, we may further match some rewards to incentivize your stakers as the Trevi system can support tripple or even more rewards at a time!&#x20;

### How to list a staking contract in Invest (as a project team)?

Introduce yourself and share your smart contracts through our [Discord](https://discord.furucombo.app/) #developer channel.

As different staking contracts may require different levels of integration work, please be patient that we will need some time to check the composability.&#x20;

We will prioritize our schedule for those who have used the [Furucombo Trevi](https://docs.furucombo.app/dev/furucombo-trevi) to create your staking and reward distribution contracts as it's a proof of love =)

# Collaboration

### How to list a staking contract in Invest (as a project team)?

Introduce yourself and share your smart contracts through our [Discord](https://discord.furucombo.app) #developer channel.

If you have used the [Furucombo Trevi](https://docs.furucombo.app/dev/furucombo-trevi) to create your staking and reward distribution contracts, it would be easy for us to integrate! Remember to share both of your Fountain and Angel contracts.

If you are using other types of staking contracts, we will need more time to check the composability.

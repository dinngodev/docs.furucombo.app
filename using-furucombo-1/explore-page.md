# Learn Page

### Navigating Learn page&#x20;

The [Learn page](https://furucombo.app/explore) serves as the DeFi strategy sharing center, letting you discover the top used combos under the Ethereum network. Here, you will see a gallery of strategies that have been built on Furucombo. When you click a strategy, you will be taken to a page where we explain the purpose of it and how this strategy is composed of cubes. Other features of the Learn page also include filtering strategies by popular tags and displaying relevant information, such as APY, liquidity, and rewards. With these features, users may find their combo more easily.

### Can I list a combo I created on the explore page?

Share it on the discord channel #combohacking, and Furucombo team will list new combos from the channel every other week onto the explore page.

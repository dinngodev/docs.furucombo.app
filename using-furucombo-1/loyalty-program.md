# Loyalty Program V2

![](../.gitbook/assets/loyalty-program.gif)

Furucombo is happy to announce we are updating our loyalty and points program to be more inclusive of our new products that have launched. This includes the standard create mode, invest mode, and fund mode. The V2 loyalty program will start on June 6th, and the old point system will no longer be active.

What’s new from the old point system:

* Points are broken up into rounds
* Points will expire at the end of each round
* The first round will last 3 months

## How to Earn Points <a href="#1928" id="1928"></a>

Points can be earned from any of the Furucombo products: create or [invest](https://docs.furucombo.app/using-furucombo-1/tutorials/furucombo-invest-tutorial) (pool, [farm](https://medium.com/furucombo/furucombo-invest-tutorial-563e0e7dcd58/#8108), or [fund](https://medium.com/furucombo/introduction-to-furucombo-funds-861926f698ee))

From create mode:

* users can earn 1 point for every $1000 in funds on either the Ethereum or Polygon networks.
* Including pooling

From invest mode:

* users can earn 20 points per week for every $1000 staked in an [auto-invest farm](https://docs.furucombo.app/using-furucombo-1/tutorials/furucombo-invest-tutorial).
* users can earn 30 points per week for every $1000 staked in a [fund](https://medium.com/furucombo/introduction-to-furucombo-funds-861926f698ee) (up to $10k total staked)
  * Every subsequent $1000 increment amount greater than $10k will earn 15 points per week up to $25k
  * Every subsequent $1000 increment amount greater than $25k will earn 7.5 points per week up to $50k
  * Every subsequent $1000 increment amount greater than $50k will earn 3 points per week up to $100k
  * Every subsequent $1000 increment amount greater than $100k will earn 1.5 points per week up to $250k

## Utility of Points V2 <a href="#5436" id="5436"></a>

For the new point system, in the first round, the utility will be share tokens. Every 500 points will earn you $1 of share tokens in a fund of your choice. The Furucombo team will provide $1000 worth of share tokens to be claimed for each month, with a total of 3 months or $3000 of share tokens.

Once the points are requested to be redeemed, the user will need to stake at least $1000 for 7 days in the investment fund before the Furucombo team releases those share tokens. At the end of the lock period, the share tokens will be provided to the user, and the funds will no longer be required to be staked if the user chooses.

Each address can claim up to 50 share tokens per month. Once the user has accumulated enough points to make a claim, they can do so via this form. There will be a snapshot date and time each month that a user has to make a request by in order to make a claim.

Here’s the form for claiming share tokens: [https://forms.gle/Lr4J1CxLSW4DdTbY7](https://forms.gle/Lr4J1CxLSW4DdTbY7)

## Points Interface <a href="#6e6c" id="6e6c"></a>

You can check your accumulated points on the wallet tab on Furucombo. Points will be updated by the Furucombo team once a day.

## Loyalty NFTs <a href="#96b5" id="96b5"></a>

The NFTs from the previous loyalty program will still be active in V2 with some adjustments. Each user will only be able to hold one of each of the loyalty cubes (wooden, metal, and diamond). Extra NFTs will be redeemable back to points. Previously minted NFTs will also be redeemable for points according to the schedule that follows. Anyone with these NFTs can apply to have points added to their accounts based on the NFTs that they hold. It will not be required to burn your NFTs, and you will still own your NFTs as we did not want users to lose their momentos. Additionally, we ask users to redeem their NFTs for points just in case they want to save their point redemption for a different round. Each round will have a deadline for applying for the points to be redeemed, and will be announced on our social media.

Here’s the form for NFT Point Redemption: [https://forms.gle/dUV8k7sH4nyd2sHy7](https://forms.gle/dUV8k7sH4nyd2sHy7)

## NFT Point Redemption Schedule <a href="#96b5" id="96b5"></a>

Furucombo’s previously minted NFTs can be redeemed for the following amount of points:

* Aave: 500 points
* Pizza Slices: 500 points
* Extra Wooden Cubes (greater than 1): 1500 points
* Extra Metal Cubes: 3000 points
* Extra Diamond Cubes: 9000 points

## Transmute Points into Cubes <a href="#96b5" id="96b5"></a>

Once you have collected enough points, you will be able to transmute them into unique cubes with special effects. Cubes can currently only be transmuted on the Ethereum blockchain.

Once live, to transmute your points into a cube, visit our campaign page on Galaxy Ecosystem. There you will be able to perform a transaction to burn your points to transmute a cube. Once transmuted, the cube will also be upgradable from wood to metal and then to diamond.

Note that points & NFTs are updated daily so they may not immediately reflect in your wallet UI. Each cube has its own unique benefits.

### Transmutation: <a href="#4b20" id="4b20"></a>

**1. Wooden Cube**

* Requires 1500 points to transmute a Wooden Cube

**2. Metal Cube**

* Requires 1 Wooden Cube & 3000 points to transmute to a Metal Cube

**3. Diamond Cube**

* Requires 1 Metal Cube & 9000 points to transmute to a Diamond Cube

## Cube Benefits <a href="#ea89" id="ea89"></a>

Each style of cube has its own unique benefits. Some effects are passive, meaning you will receive the benefit simply by holding the NFT in your wallet, and some are active, meaning you have to perform a task to receive the benefit (such as gas reimbursement). When in possession of the cube, you will receive the following:

**1. Wooden Cube**

* The Wooden Cube grants a 1.1x multiplier on points generated
* Passive effect (bonus will apply automatically)

**2. Metal Cube**

* The Metal Cube grants a 1.1x multiplier on points generated
* The Metal Cube will grant a loyalty airdrop to its holders.
  * The loyalty airdrop schedule to be determined by the Furucombo Team

**3. Diamond Cube**

* The Diamond Cube grants a 1.1x multiplier on points generated
* The Diamond Cube will grant a loyalty airdrop to its holders.
  * The loyalty airdrop schedule to be determined by the Furucombo Team
* Exclusive high yield farming option
* Off-line event invitations
* VIP support & unique Discord role
* Furucombo swag pack

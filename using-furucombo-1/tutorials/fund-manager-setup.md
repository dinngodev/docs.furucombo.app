![](../../.gitbook/assets/0\_jrqJPpsrokb\_IDFf.png)

### **Introduction:** <a href="#547e" id="547e"></a>

With the long-awaited [Fund system](https://medium.com/furucombo/introduction-to-furucombo-funds-861926f698ee) launch, we have pushed the opportunity for investment to the next level. Furucombo Fund is an investment platform that matches fund managers and investors on the Polygon network.

As a Fund manager, you can now create your own portfolio on Furucombo. This will demonstrate your trading talent, attract people to invest in your fund, and make use of funds to generate more profit than otherwise would be possible!

For this guide, we will be showing you all the details that you need to know when managing a fund. If you are more of a visual learner, feel free to watch our fund manager workshop video at: [https://youtu.be/DqS80h4p36M](https://youtu.be/DqS80h4p36M).

### **Creating a Fund:** <a href="#d1e5" id="d1e5"></a>

Okay, let‚Äôs get started! So how to create a Fund? In the trial run, to maintain the quality of public funds, we won‚Äôt yet open the system to the public. You‚Äôll need to submit your information first through this form: [https://forms.gle/4BYF14WFjAbgLdjd9](https://forms.gle/4BYF14WFjAbgLdjd9) to apply for a fund manager role. The Furucombo team will then interview you. After interviewing, we‚Äôll create a fund for you and also a private Discord channel for you to keep in touch with the core team!

The Fund Manager application requires the following information:

`1` Fund name: {Your Fund Name} Fund

* A fund‚Äôs name will be shown on the Furucombo invest page and in the contract.

`2` Management fee rate (%):

* A management fee is a pro-rata fee calculated periodically for the assets under a fund‚Äôs management and is independent of fund returns paid by fund investors to the fund manager.
* The system will use share tokens as a form of payment tokens.

`3` Performance fee rate (%):

* A performance fee is a pro-rata fee that a fund manager can collect from a fund‚Äôs positive return made over a crystallization period.
* The system will use share tokens, charged from fund investors, as a form of payment token to pay off.
* It‚Äôll have a crystallization period as it can reflect more accurately a fund‚Äôs overall performance.

`4` Crystallization Period (day):

* The crystallization period is a parameter which can be set by the Vault Manager. Typically it will be set longer than 3 months. The effect of the crystallization period can prevent the performance fee from affecting potential future earnings due to short-term market fluctuations.

`5` Fund owner (wallet address):

* Fund manager‚Äôs wallet address ‚Äî the address that a fund manager uses to open & manage a fund.

**Example:**

1. Fund name: LFG Fund
2. Management fee rate (%): 10%
3. Performance fee rate (%): 10%
4. Crystallization period (day): 100 days
5. Owner (wallet address): 0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

### **Fund Interface:** <a href="#9f76" id="9f76"></a>

After being whitelisted in Fund, a ‚ÄúManage‚Äù page will be added to your Furucombo page in the upper-left corner (on the Polygon network). You can easily change the network by clicking the switch. Then, click the ‚ÄúManage‚Äù button, and you can access your private fund page. Once you enter the page, you can see all of your funds under your management.

The fund manager should increase their position in their reserve (USDC) to the fund to get its health factor under control again; otherwise, the fund will be liquidated after the Insufficient period elapses.](../../.gitbook/assets/0\_7y7JcLCAtraYyRMd.png)

Status:

* There are four types of status that will be shown.
  * Operating: The cash balance is positive.
  * Insufficient: The cash balance is negative.
  * Liquidating: The cash balance has been negative for over 72 hours, so the fund will be liquidated for all depositors to withdraw.

On the strategy page, you can create a new strategy as well as see all the strategies that you executed. To make a new trade, just hit the ‚ÄòNew‚Äô button on the upper right of the screen, and it will lead you to a specific create page just for your fund. The page is almost the same as the original create page except for the initial fund section. It‚Äôll show you the value of tokens you‚Äôll receive, and how many cash reserves will remain after using the strategy.

**Furucombo Fees:**

Furucombo will also charge a 0.2% fund fee on each of the transactions performed by the fund manager based on the AUM. For example, if a fund manager performs a swap, and has $10,000 AUM, a 0.2% fee on the $10k AUM will be charged for performing that swap.

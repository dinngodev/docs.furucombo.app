### What are Compound smart cubes?

The smart cubes are advanced features on Furucombo and only users with a DSProxy smart wallet can use them. You can easily create a DSProxy smart wallet on Furucombo within 3 transactions, and you can skip 1 of them if you have ever created a vault on Maker or a smart wallet on DeFi Saver.

Okay, so why do we need a smart wallet to use Compound borrow cube? Because if we donâ€™t, when people using Furucombo to create collateral-and-debt positions on Compound, all positions would be mixed together as Compound protocol could only see it as 1 smart contractâ€™s position, which is the Furucombo proxy contract. But with the smart wallet structure, usersâ€™ individual positions will be recorded under each smart wallet, and could be controlled only by the owner of the smart wallet. The related smart contract has been audited by Haechi with zero critical issues found. Check the report [here](https://docs.furucombo.app/resources/audit).

Once you create the smart wallet and create your Compound collateral-and-debt position, you would see a dashboard for the position in the wallet tab, and you could then use the Compound smart cubes to manage the position.

Reminder: The Compound collateral-and-debt position is manageable under both Furucombo and DeFi Saver as we share the same DSProxy structure.

# What is liquidation

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/G Copy (1).png>)

Liquidation occurs when an investor cannot meet the margin requirement for their leveraged position & the underlying collateral tokens will be converted to pay for the liquidation.

### Liquidation vs Forced liquidation <a href="#1cc2" id="1cc2"></a>

**Liquidation:**\
Means selling collateral for cash, or its equivalents.

**Forced liquidation:**\
Occurs when a trader‚Äôs position is closed forcibly by lending protocols as the trader ran out of the initial margin used to open the position.

### What causes a forced liquidation? <a href="#0ce9" id="0ce9"></a>

When the price begins to move against the trader‚Äôs expectation (either long or short position), the losses are paid for from the margin provided. If the losses surpass the margin provided, the position gets liquidated.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Know the liquidation rules before you open a position.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Raise your collateral ratio by depositing more collateral or repaying part of your loan. It‚Äôs important to monitor your collateral ratio & keep it high enough to avoid liquidation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt leverage too much.\
Leveraged positions are prone to volatile price swings, which may cause a trader‚Äôs investment to plunge into a negative balance in a very short time period. Measure how much risk can you afford to take before you open a position.

### Total Supply: 100,000,000 COMBO tokens

* 25,000,000 for Core Team & Future Hire \(vested\)
* 2,500,000 for Advisors \(vested\)
* 19,500,000 for Investors & Shareholders \(vested\)
* 48,000,000 for Community Growth
* 5,000,000 for Mitigation Pool

The long-term success of Furucombo lies in the hands of the community. With that in mind, we’re committed to never stop giving back. We allocate the majority of the COMBO token supply for the community, which will gradually be distributed to Furucombo users. Eventually, it will be COMBO holders’ call to decide how we distribute the tokens.

The core development team is committed to the long-term success of Furucombo with a 48-month vesting plan \(10-month cliff, linear vested\). The portion of advisors, investors, and shareholders are also vested for 48-month with a 10-month cliff, 15-month with a 3-month cliff, 15-month with a 3-month cliff, respectively.

Due to [the exploit ](https://medium.com/furucombo/furucombo-post-mortem-march-2021-ad19afd415e)that occurred on Saturday 27 February 2021, we are aiming to create and distribute 5M iouCOMBO tokens, which will be subject to a 360-day linear-vesting period, and the recovery pool in April. While the vesting starts from March 1st, anyone with the iouCOMBO token can claim the respected COMBO to date in the recovery pool. \([more info](https://medium.com/furucombo/mitigation-plan-e498a95d335e)\)

# For Masters

> As more Builders list their cubes, the more profit-discovery combos Furucombo Masters can create.

Furucombo Masters are sophisticated traders who are gaming DeFi money legos like a pro - particularly those who have endless strategies and ideas to maximize their profits.

## The benefit of a Furucombo Master

Share your strategy to earn much more!

* You can get a referral code for the combo you create, and share the fees collected when someone uses your combo.
* You can create a pool combo to be a fund manager and charge performance & management fees for your hard work.
* If you are also a Furucombo Governor, your reward will be boosted depending on the vCOMBO you have.

## To be a Furucombo Master

Creating a combo is permission-less. No vote & no approval needed. As long as you get the know-how of building a profitable strategy, you get to become a combo master!

You manage your wealth along with the wealth of others - Itâ€™s a win-win.

Furucombo is free of charge at the moment and the Governors can vote to decide the rate once the governance portal goes live.
